		<h1>The Relay Race that is our Internet infrastructure!</h1>
		<h4><em> Kiera McKechnie </em></h4>

		<p><em> In this modern era, our productivity, efficency, and frankly our entire lives depends on the internet infrastructure we see and overlook everyday. The devices delved into in the web page provide a critical communication path between one another, which allows us to get internet connection in our homes and communities. We are niave to the number of players that go into our seemingly instantaneous wifi connections. In this web page I will discuss the five key players which are in this ongoing relay race we formally call the internet!.

	<header>
		<section id = Manholes>
			<h2> Player 1 - Manholes </h2>
			<p><em> It is true, the internet is everywhere. Manhole covers you see on every street are one sneaky way of containing huge networks of cables which provide a pathway for our data to go to and fro. In the United Kingdom, Manhole covers are being adapted to contain fibre-connected 5G enabled atennae to improve the internet coverage, this could be something to look out for in the coming years here in Wellington! </em></p>

		<section id = UndergroundCables>
			<h2> Player 2 - Underground Cables </h2>
			<p><em> These cheeky thick cables you may notice poking out from underground are copper and fibre optic cables! Underground storage of these is important as it provides protection from both physical and environmental abuse. The fibre optic cables specifically transfer information through pulses of light, whereas copper cables transmit electrical currents. Both contain internet and are fundamental players!  </em></p>

			<section id = AbovegroundCables>
			<h2> Player 3 - Aboveground Cables </h2>
			<p><em> They are underneath us, but also above! Some of these fibre optic cables are also installed alongside power lines. There is that much internet and data, the internet practically surrounding us. These cables help to bring faster and more efficent internet connection to us.  </em></p>

		<section id = ETP>
			<h2>Player 4 - ETP!</h2>
			<p><em>These Fibre boxes, aka 'ETP's, aka 'External Termination Points' are hidden in plain site attached to the outside of our homes and buildings. These boxes are the entry point for fibre cable to network into our homes. They connect to the fibre from our streets to then connect inside. </em> </p>

		<section id = ONT>
			<h2> Player 5 - ONT! </h2>
			<p><em> Player 3 here is like the ETP's sister, she sits on a wall inside your home, pretty close the internet router. The ONT, aka Optical Network Terminal connects the fibre from the ETP to pass on to the next player; the router! </em></p>

	<section id = "Routers">
			<h2>Player 6 - Internet Routers</h2>
			<p><em> This bad boy looks seemingly to be the main guy in the game, but little do most of us know the hard work is done way before the internet reaches our routers. The router is just another player along the chain, it's job is to direct the incoming and outgoing internet traffic on that network in the fastest and most efficent way it can. </em></p>
